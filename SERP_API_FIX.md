# SerpAPI Integration Fix

## Issue

The SerpAPI integration was not returning any results when searching for medical information. The error message indicated:

```json

  "search_metadata": {

}
```

## Root Cause

The issue was with the `as_sitesearch` parameter in the SerpAPI request. When this parameter is used, SerpAPI converts it to a `site:` operator in the query, but the syntax was incorrect.

The query was being displayed as:

```
Diabetes medical information health site:mayoclinic.org,medlineplus.gov,nih.gov,who.int,cdc.gov
```

This is not the correct syntax for the `site:` operator in Google search. When searching across multiple domains, each domain needs its own `site:` operator, combined with the OR operator.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the `search_medical_info` and `get_medical_news` methods in the `SerpService` class to construct the query with the correct syntax for the `site:` operator.

### Changes Made

1. In the `search_medical_info` method:

   - Removed the `as_sitesearch` parameter
   - Added code to construct a query with the correct `site:` operator syntax
   - The new query format is:
     ```
     {query} medical information health (site:mayoclinic.org OR site:medlineplus.gov OR site:nih.gov OR site:who.int OR site:cdc.gov)
     ```

2. In the `get_medical_news` method:
   - Added code to construct a query with the correct `site:` operator syntax for news sources
   - The new query format is:
     ```
     {topic} latest medical research news (site:nih.gov OR site:medlineplus.gov OR site:mayoclinic.org OR ...)
     ```

### Code Changes

#### Before:

```python
# Add medical context to the query
medical_query = f"{query} medical information health"

# SerpAPI implementation
params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": medical_query,
    "api_key": self.api_key,
    "num": num_results,
    # Add medical sites to prioritize in results
    "as_sitesearch": "mayoclinic.org,medlineplus.gov,nih.gov,who.int,cdc.gov",
    "safe": "active"  # Safe search to filter inappropriate content
}
```

#### After:

```python
# Add medical context to the query
medical_query = f"{query} medical information health"

# Create site restriction using site: operator
sites = ["mayoclinic.org", "medlineplus.gov", "nih.gov", "who.int", "cdc.gov"]
site_query = " OR ".join([f"site:{site}" for site in sites])
full_query = f"{medical_query} ({site_query})"

# SerpAPI implementation
params = {
    "engine": "google",
    "q": full_query,
    "api_key": self.api_key,
    "num": num_results,
    "safe": "active"  # Safe search to filter inappropriate content
}
```

## Testing

Two test scripts were created to verify the fix:

1. `test_serp_api_fix.py` - A comprehensive test script that tests different approaches to the site search parameter
2. `test_serp_api_fix_simple.py` - A simple test script that verifies the updated implementation

To run the tests:

```bash
python test_serp_api_fix_simple.py
```

## Additional Information

### SerpAPI Documentation

For more information about the SerpAPI parameters and usage, refer to the official documentation:
https://serpapi.com/search-api

### Google Search Operators

The `site:` operator in Google search is used to restrict search results to specific domains. When searching across multiple domains, each domain needs its own `site:` operator, combined with the OR operator.

Example:

```
diabetes (site:mayoclinic.org OR site:nih.gov)
```

This will search for "diabetes" on both mayoclinic.org and nih.gov.
