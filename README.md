The AI Doctor is a virtual healthcare assistant application that provides a medical consultation experience. Built with Python, Streamlit and powered by OpenAI's GPT models, it provides personalized data-driven medical guidance through an interactive interface.

## Core Functionality

The virtual doctor agent:

1. **Collects Patient Information** through an intuitive form interface (demographics, symptoms, medical history, medications)

2. **Analyzes Health Data** using three sophisticated systems:

   - Bayesian reasoning for probabilistic diagnosis
   - Systems Medicine approach that views the body as interconnected (rather than compartmentalized)
   - SERP API integration for up-to-date medical information

3. **Provides Holistic Assessment** by:

   - Identifying connections between seemingly unrelated symptoms
   - Recognizing patterns across multiple body systems
   - Considering how lifestyle factors affect overall health
   - Weaving together insights from multiple medical specialties

4. **Delivers Personalized Guidance** including:

   - Potential explanations for symptoms
   - Lifestyle recommendations
   - Suggestions for when to seek in-person care

The application emphasizes a unified healthcare approach that addresses the limitations of compartmentalized medicine, recognizing that inflammation, diet, stress, and other factors are intertwined across multiple body systems.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns:

- **app.py**: Contains the main application logic, session state management, and API calls
- **ui.py**: Contains all UI components, styling, and rendering functions

### AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models and Agents framework to power the virtual doctor assistant:

- System instructions define the assistant's role and limitations
- Patient information including BMI assessment is added to the conversation context
- The assistant maintains a conversational history for context-aware responses
- Specialized agents handle specific tasks like BMI calculation

### SERP API Integration

The application integrates with SERP API to provide up-to-date medical information:

- **Medical Information Retrieval**: Enhances responses with current medical information from reputable sources
- **Intelligent Enhancement**: Automatically determines when to supplement responses with web search results
- **Source Validation**: Prioritizes trusted medical sources like Mayo Clinic, NIH, CDC, and WHO
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Includes appropriate disclaimers with information from web searches
- **Rate Limiting and Caching**: Implements rate limiting and caching to optimize API usage

For detailed information about the SERP API integration, see [SERP_API_INTEGRATION.md](SERP_API_INTEGRATION.md).

### Bayesian Reasoning

The application uses a custom Bayesian probability engine for medical diagnosis:

- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Represents uncertainty using probability distributions rather than single values
- **Prior Knowledge**: Incorporates medical knowledge in the form of prior probabilities and conditional probabilities
- **Belief Updating**: Updates beliefs using Bayes' rule when new symptoms are observed
- **Information-Theoretic Question Selection**: Selects questions to ask based on information gain
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Maintains multiple hypotheses rather than prematurely focusing on a single diagnosis
- **Internal Reasoning**: Keeps the Bayesian diagnostic assessment internal to the agent, not displaying technical probability information to patients

The Bayesian engine works behind the scenes to guide the doctor agent's reasoning and question selection, providing more accurate and relevant responses without overwhelming patients with technical details.

For detailed information about the Bayesian enhancement, see [BAYESIAN_ENHANCEMENT.md](BAYESIAN_ENHANCEMENT.md).

For detailed information about the Systems Medicine enhancement, see [SYSTEMS_MEDICINE_ENHANCEMENT.md](SYSTEMS_MEDICINE_ENHANCEMENT.md).

### Systems Medicine Approach

The application implements a unified healthcare approach using a Systems Medicine model:

- **Interconnected Body Systems**: Views the body as one interconnected system rather than isolated compartments
- **Cross-Domain Symptom Analysis**: Identifies connections between symptoms across different body systems
- **Multi-Specialty Integration**: Weaves together insights from multiple medical specialties (neurology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, etc.)
- **Lifestyle Factor Analysis**: Considers how diet, sleep, stress, and exercise affect multiple systems simultaneously
- **Holistic Interventions**: Suggests lifestyle modifications that address multiple systems at once
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns that cross traditional medical boundaries

The Systems Medicine model works alongside the Bayesian engine to provide a more comprehensive and holistic approach to healthcare, addressing the issue of compartmentalized medicine that often fails to connect symptoms across different specialties.

### Feedback System

The application includes a comprehensive feedback collection and analysis system:

- **Feedback Collection**: Users can provide feedback at the end of their session by clicking the "End Session & Provide Feedback" button
- **Rating System**: Users can rate their experience on a scale of 1-5 stars across multiple dimensions:
  - Overall satisfaction
  - Helpfulness of responses
  - Clarity of information
  - Empathy and bedside manner
  - Perceived accuracy of information
- **Comments**: Users can provide qualitative feedback through an open text field
- **Data Storage**: Feedback is stored in a CSV file for persistence and easy analysis
- **Feedback Dashboard**: A dedicated dashboard visualizes feedback data with:
  - Key statistics (total submissions, average ratings, positive feedback rate)
  - Rating breakdowns by category
  - Distribution of overall ratings
  - Common themes extracted from comments
  - Recent feedback entries
  - Data export functionality

To view the feedback dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run feedback_dashboard.py
```

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Evaluation and Feedback Mechanisms

- No built-in way to evaluate the quality of the agent's responses
- Lacks metrics for measuring conversation effectiveness or patient satisfaction
- Could benefit from a feedback system to improve responses over time

### 2. Diagnostic Limitations
