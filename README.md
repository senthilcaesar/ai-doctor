A futuristic, sci-fi inspired virtual doctor assistant application built with Streamlit and powered by OpenAI's GPT models. This application simulates a virtual doctor that collects patient health information through an interactive form and allows patients to discuss their health concerns with an AI assistant.

> **Note:** This application does not provide medical advice or diagnosis. It is for demonstration purposes only.

  - Automatically calculate BMI based on patient's height and weight
  - Determine BMI category (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)
  - Provide detailed health assessment based on BMI
  - Offer personalized health recommendations
  - Uses OpenAI Agents framework for intelligent analysis

- **Virtual Doctor Chat**

  - Discuss health concerns with an AI-powered virtual doctor
  - Context-aware conversations based on submitted patient information
  - BMI assessment incorporated into the doctor's initial response
  - Support for multiple OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo)

- **User Interface**
  - Intuitive navigation between data input and virtual doctor chat
  - Futuristic sci-fi inspired design with custom styling
  - Responsive layout that works on various screen sizes
  - Table-based information display for better readability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **AI**: OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **AI Framework**: OpenAI Agents Python library
- **Data Handling**: Pandas

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-doctor-assistant.git
   cd virtual-doctor-assistant
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

3. Fill out the patient information form:

   - Navigate through the tabs to provide your information
   - Required fields are in the Basic Info and Symptoms tabs
   - Enter your height and weight to receive a BMI assessment
   - Review your information in the Submit Information tab
   - Click "Submit Information" to proceed

4. Chat with the virtual doctor:
   - After submitting your information, click on the "Virtual Doctor" button in the sidebar
   - The virtual doctor will acknowledge your BMI assessment and provide health recommendations
   - Type your messages in the chat input field
   - Receive responses from the AI-powered virtual doctor

## üîç Implementation Details

### Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with separation of concerns:

- **app.py**: Contains the main application logic, session state management, and API calls
- **ui.py**: Contains all UI components, styling, and rendering functions

### Key Components

1. **Patient Information Form**

   - Multi-tab interface for collecting different categories of information
   - Form validation to ensure required fields are filled
   - Custom HTML tables for displaying information in the review section

2. **BMI Calculation System**

   - Uses the OpenAI Agents Python library to create a specialized BMI calculator agent
   - Converts height and weight to appropriate units for calculation
   - Determines BMI category based on calculated value
   - Provides detailed health assessment and recommendations
   - Integrates seamlessly with the patient information summary

3. **Navigation System**

   - Sidebar navigation with "Input Data" and "Virtual Doctor" buttons
   - Visual indicators for the active view
   - Conditional enabling of the Virtual Doctor button

4. **Chat Interface**

   - Integration with OpenAI's API for generating responses
   - Context-aware conversations using the patient's information including BMI assessment
   - Enhanced chat UI with larger message display area

5. **Session State Management**
   - Persistent storage of patient information
   - Conversation history tracking
   - View state management

### AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT models and Agents framework to power the virtual doctor assistant:

- System instructions define the assistant's role and limitations
- Patient information including BMI assessment is added to the conversation context
- The assistant maintains a conversational history for context-aware responses
- Specialized agents handle specific tasks like BMI calculation

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Add authentication for patient privacy
- Implement data encryption for sensitive information
- Add support for file uploads (medical records, images)
- Integrate with medical databases for more accurate responses
- Add multilingual support
- Implement voice input/output capabilities
- Create a mobile-friendly version
- Expand health metrics beyond BMI (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)
